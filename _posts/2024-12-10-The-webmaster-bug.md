Every so often I'll catch the webmaster bug; something I see on the internet will inspire me to add something to this site, and then I'll leave it alone for months on end until I catch it again.

This time, I saw someone on social media link to [HTML for People](https://htmlforpeople.com/), a beginner's guide to getting a website online. Even though I already have a website up (believe it or not!), I still read through the whole thing. And it's a good thing that I did, since I learned about things like [how to spin up a local server so I don't have to just open .html files](https://htmlforpeople.com/intermission-installing-a-local-web-server/), or [how to embed YouTube videos in a way that doesn't suck](https://htmlforpeople.com/adding-a-fun-page/#embedded-video).

Then, I wanted to find out who made it. Helpfully, the author's personal site is linked in the footer, which lead me to find [a blog spot on how and why they made HTML for People](https://blakewatson.com/journal/the-making-of-html-for-people/). From this, I went on to read a good chunk of their blog, which eventually lead me to [this page on ideas for what to do for your website](https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/) by someone completely different.

At this point, the webmaster bug was in full effect. I started rediscovering how wonderful the open Web is, which is the same revelation that lead me to make this website in the first place.

*My website's home page, back in 199-- oh, sorry, 2022.*

Not too long after, I had this same epiphany, which pushed me to redesign this website.

*My website's home page, from 2023 onwards.*

Now, I was inspired again. It definitely helped that I had a whole list of ideas, but the reason I was driven to give them a shot is because of all these factors; rediscovering personal blogs, remembering how valuable having an online space besides social media is, thinking about how fun it is to muck around with HTML and CSS...

So, I made what I call [a "more" page](https://www.santumerino.com/more). It links to every part of the website—including places for which you previously just had to somehow _know_ the direct URL—, and includes external links to some of the websites which I've found inspiring over the years. I definitely plan on expanding this more. I also did a bit of house cleaning; I set up a robots.txt file that, hopefully, pushes scrapers for LLMs away from the site, I got rid of a few old things and changed a few things that were there, and I updated some _very_ old pages as well.

However, the biggest impact the webmaster bug had on me is driving me to write this very blog post. I've really been neglecting it, mainly because I feel as though nobody would care about what I say, unless it's 280 characters or shorter (if even that!), and therefore sitting down to write something meandering and long-form like this has no point...

...that's dumb! This is _my_ website, so it genuinely doesn't matter if nobody reads this, as long as I find writing it fulfilling! And I do!

I think the reason for this is because of the webmaster bug's evil cousin, the social media disease. That's a whole other topic though, which would probably be better saved for another day. For now, though, I'm glad I rediscovered the reasons why I made this website in the first place.

When I end up forgetting them, I hope I'll remember them again.
